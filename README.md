rainulf-cms
===========
rainulf-cms is the CMS/blog web application that Rainulf is using to run his website (http://rainulf.ca/). 
It is coded in PHP, HTML5, JavaScript and mySQL from scratch, no frameworks are used besides the jQuery library.

History
-------
I started working on it way back around 2009. I was curious on testing the skills I gained in web development. 
Since then, rainulf-cms undergoes a lot of changes - ranging from its database design to programming concepts/design. 
I update the web application from time to time as I my knowledge in programming matures. Hopefully, people will find 
it a useful learning/reference material.
